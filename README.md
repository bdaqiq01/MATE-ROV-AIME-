# MATE-ROV-AIME-
Hello
This repository will contain the code for controlling an under water rover for MATE-ROV compeition. 
The code will enable efficient control and navigation for underwater robotic projects, utilizing components such as Raspberry Pi, thrusters, ESC motor controllers, servos,
 and ROS2 and python softwares. 
It currenctly contains the nodes for the thruster controller, borameter and the IMU sensor, which are currently being improve on.


Coming Soon
Controller Logic: Code for controlling thrusters, handling motor controllers, and integrating sensor data.
ROS2 Integration: ROS2 nodes and topics for communication between various hardware components and the controller.
Testing and Debugging: Scripts for testing individual components, such as the thrusters and ESCs, ensuring seamless communication and functionality.
Documentation: Detailed documentation for setting up the controller, required hardware, and how to run and modify the code.
